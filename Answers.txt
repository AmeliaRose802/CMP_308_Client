If you remove the hton function from the client it will no longer be able to connect to the server. The computer appears to store the port number in little endian notation by default. When the other program receves it it attemps to intriprit it in Network Bite Order (Big Endian) which means that it will get the wrong port number and not be able to find the program it should be talking to.

The client fails to connect to the server with error code 10061 so abort is called on the program.
If you stop the server when the client is running the next attempt to send data causes an error message that the server has closed the connection. The program lets the user know it is quitting and lets the user press any key to exit. 
If you close the client while the server is running the server resumes waiting for connections. If the client is restarted it can reconnect.

If you remove bind listen will fail. If you remove listen the program will fail on connect. The functions might be seprated so you can debug easier. It could also allow you to bind a port and reserve it before you want to listen for connections. Not sure why, ask
